            "title": "You Will Get Bored",
            "content": "Tl;dr: If you are worried with what you could do if you don‚Äôt have your 9-5 job, I‚Äôm providing you two lists of suggestions and inspirations below. One is my own, another is curated from Reddit threads . The need for a list of post-retirement activities for inspirations . If you are a follower of the FIRE movement and discuss it with people, you probably at some point have had a conversation similar to the following: . You: ‚ÄúI want to retire at 35 years old.‚Äù . Them: ‚ÄúWhat are you gonna do with your life???? You‚Äôll get bored!!‚Äù . There are many ways to rebut to the critism above. Here I‚Äôm quickly mentioning a couple of ways that you can go about it: . The RE part is optional, you have the choice, that‚Äôs what matters. | Retiring from 9-5 job is not the same as sitting idle and rotting away. | I‚Äôm bored right now at work. | Listing all the activities you would rather be doing instead of working. | etc etc | . For the other rebuttals, there are many other resources that can explain and dive deeper much better than I can. However, with regards to the last point, I have not seen a good list of possible activities for early retirees outside of the obvious answers (opening your own business, exercising, reading, traveling, spend time with family). Although the exact post-retirement activities are highly specific to each person‚Äôs hobbies and preferences, seeing a list of fun, interesting, diverse, self-enriching activities can serve as inspiration to get the creative juice flowing so you can come up with your own activities. Therefore, I think seeing a good list can benefit everyone, from the FIRE nay-sayers to FIRE followers who believe that they won‚Äôt stop working until normal retirement age even if they are FI. . I‚Äôm sharing my own list and a list I compiled from two reddit threads (this and this). Hopefully, after reading this list, you will realize that while there are some things to consider when you ‚Äúwin the game too early‚Äù, being ‚Äúbored‚Äù is a choice, and so does making work your entire identity. . DISCLAIMER: Yes, I acknowledge that there are people who are very passionate about what they do at their job, and it brings them genuine joy and purpose, and they believe that it‚Äôs their calling. However, I suspect that those who enjoy working 9-5 above anything else might not be the majority, or else this reddit thread would not exist, neither would this subreddit, nor this super popular book. . I love my job, every day, I get to learn new things about the biological world, push the limits of human knowledge, contribute to science and possible future therapies. My job as a researcher is extremely intellectually rewarding, I have ample autonomy to explore the scientific questions I‚Äôm interested in, and I‚Äôm surrounded with arguably some of the best minds in the world. However, the world just have so much to offer that I want to see/try/explore/learn them all. I truly believe that every day you are crafting your own human experience, and getting as many diverse experiences can make your story colorful. . . My list . I think a Redditor articulated perfectly my thinking approach to this so I will just quote them here, since I think my list encapsulates their goal/mantra . My goal would really be to be some type of modern day renaissance man, where I could hop from hobby to hobby and establish a level of competence in each one. . Note 1: The links accompanied by the ideas are either my inspiration for the idea, elaboration of the idea, or an example of someone who‚Äôs already doing it. . Note 2: The document for this list was created on September 7th 2020 with the initial ideas. Since then, I have been adding slowly to it. I will occasionally bulk-update this list . Food .

Final thoughts: . Hopefully these activities will keep you busy. Each of these activities can take a life time to master. If you want to be a dabbler, do a bit of each one without achieving mastery, that‚Äôs fine too!!! I also understand that some activities are not available to you because of age/family commitments/finance/preference. I would love to hear about what you come up with using this list as inspiration. . Finally, it‚Äôs also completely fine to be bored and do nothing!!! Sometimes, the ‚Äúfast pace‚Äù lifestyle is over-glorified, making it seems like there‚Äôs only one definition of ‚Äúa good life‚Äù, whatever that means. Don‚Äôt play games you don‚Äôt want to win. You can be like this guy who spend hours creating his card-throwing videos. I found his focus, commitment, and sheer will mesmerizing :) .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .
